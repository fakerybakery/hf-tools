No data is collected or stored from this extension, unless you use the full-text search feature.

If you use the full-text search feature, we may temporarily log your search query, the repository you are searching, and the results. See the `backend` folder for details - the backend is fully open source!

We do not associate your search queries or results with your Hugging Face account, IP address, or other personal information.
